ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DaveW76

I have been writing computer programs since 1974.  Over the years I have learned (and in many cases eventually forgotten) many languages, including:
 - assemblers for various processors:  IBM 370, HP 2100, Motorola 6800 and 6809 and 68HC11 and 68000, TI MSP430, Microchip PIC16 and PIC18 and PIC24, Zilog Z-8000, Intel x86 and 80C196, etc.
 - high level languages: FORTRAN, PL/I, COBOL, RPGII and RPGIII, BASIC (incl. QBASIC, QuickBASIC, VB6, VBA), C, C++, Python, etc.
